Psychological studies show that we tend to be unwilling to disturb people with whom we're familiar. 

We sometimes find ourselves in situations where we simply cannot confide in friends, relatives and loved ones. 

This is when we need a friendly stranger to open up to and enjoy a relaxing chat with. 

With the popularization of those "swiping" social networking apps, users sometimes forget that our experience and stories are not written on our faces. 

Peiwo's "Anonymous Chat" feature helps break the inequality of the swipe-based social networking experience, and thereby encourages more ordinary users with extraordinary stories to participate in social networking amongst strangers.
