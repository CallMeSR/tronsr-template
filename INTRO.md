## Peiwo

Peiwo is a social networking app that connects strangers via voice calls.
Peiwo pioneered the concept of “voice-centric social networking” to create a world without swiping. Meanwhile, it created an "anonymous call" feature, with which secrets that are otherwise difficult to share can be confided. 

Peiwo overthrew the current social networking mode of mobile Internet. Through a one-click, non-swiping, non-pressure anonymous chat, Peiwo connects people in a more efficient and meaningful way. With real-time voice social networking as its cornerstone, accompanied by its unique billing system, Peiwo has achieved the monetization of time and the financialization of social networking products. Everyone will be able to make a profit through social networking; everyone's voice will be heard. 

As a result, everyone will become a partner in the product ecosystem. This is yet another breakthrough of social networking in the sharing economy. Raybo is committed to making "Peiwo" the largest mobile social and mobile payment portal for Gen Y and Gen Z.
